Here is **Qianzhi Zhang (章谦之)**. I am currently an Ezra Systems postdoctoral associate with Cornell University. I will be joining The University of Alabama’s Department Electrical and Computer Engineering as a tenure-track assistant professor in the upcoming Fall semester of 2023. I received my Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering from Iowa State University in 2022. 

# CV
Lastest Update: 14th June 2023

Here is [my CV](https://QZZ2023.github.io/file/CV_Qianzhi_Zhang_academic.pdf).

## Research Interests
My research focuses on a range of areas, including power/energy management, voltage/var control, system resilience enhancement, transportation electrification at scale, and the applications of advanced optimization and machine learning techniques in power system operation and control. My group at The University of Alabama invites applications for two fully funded Ph.D. positions for the upcoming academic year, starting either in Fall 2023 or Spring/Fall 2024. The successful candidate will work with Dr. Qianzhi Zhang in the one of the following areas:
- Modeling, simulation, and control of power systems and microgrids with renewable energy sources and inverter-based resources
- Resilience enhancement of power systems 
- Power system planning and operation with transportation electrification at scale.
